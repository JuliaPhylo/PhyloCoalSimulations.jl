    simulatecoalescent(net, nloci, nindividuals=1; nodemapping=false)

Simulate `nloci` gene trees with `nindividuals` from each species
under the multispecies network coalescent, along network `net`.
Branch lengths in `net` are interpreted as being in coalescent units
(ratio: number of generations / effective population size).
The coalescent model uses the infinite-population-size approximation.

Output: vector of gene trees, of length `nloci`.

`nindividuals` can be a single integer, or a dictionary listing the
number of individuals to be simulated for each species.

If `nodemapping` is true, each simulated gene tree is augmented with
degree-2 nodes that can be mapped to speciation or hybridization events.
The mapping of gene tree nodes & edges to network edges is carried
by the `.inCycle` attribute. The mapping of gene tree nodes to network nodes
is carried by the `.name` attribute. Namely:

- A degree-3 node (1 parent + 2 children) represents a coalescent event
  that occurred along a population *edge* in `net`. Its `.inCycle` attribute
  is set to the number of that network population edge.
  Its parent edge has its `.inCycle` attribute also set to the number of
  the population edge that it originated from.
- The gene tree's root node (of degree 2) represents a coalescent event
  along the network's root edge.
  Its `.inCycle` attribute is the number assigned to the network's root edge,
  which is set to the maximum edge number + 1.
- A leaf (or degree-1 node) represents an individual. It maps to a species
  in `net`. The individual leaf name is set to the species name
  if `nindividuals` is 1. Otherwise, its name is set to `speciesname_i`
  where `i` is the individual number in that species.
  Its `inCycle` attribute is the default `-1`.
- A non-root degree-2 node represents a speciation or hybridization and maps
  to a population *node* in `net`. Its `inCycle` attribute is the default `-1`.
  Its name is set to network node name, if it exists. If the network node
  has no name, the gene tree node is given a name built from the network node
  number.

Assumptions:
- `net` must have non-missing edge lengths and Î³ values.
- If `nindividuals` is a dictionary, it must have a key for all species, with
  the same spelling of species names in its keys as in the tip labels of `net`.
